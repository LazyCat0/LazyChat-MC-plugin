## Do it support LuckyPerms prefixes?
### I think... I do it soon.

## What is "MiniMessage"?
### This is a formating api which provided from Adventure api (Or just Paper feature)
## How to build it?

### In Inteljl IDEA
`click at maven icon, after on "lifecycle" and on "package"`
### In CLI
`just go to project folder and open it with your command-line, after type "mvn package"`


## In some moments I use AI for make this chat-plugin, because I'm Junior and newbie in plugin-develop.
